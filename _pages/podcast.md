### Microsoft Azure Application Hosting with Patrick Huber
#### February 29, 2024
Microsoft Azure offers a bunch of cool ways to host your application code, giving you the flexibility to choose how and where your app runs. When we talk about "compute," we're talking about the setup that powers your application. In this episode on Road to Cloud Podcast, I talk to Patrick Huber, Principal Architect at Microsoft, about choosing the most appropriate compute service for your app. Plus, we dive into Azure's decision tree on selecting a compute service, which can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree).
