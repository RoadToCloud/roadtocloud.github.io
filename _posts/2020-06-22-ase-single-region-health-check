# Microsoft Azure Health Check Architecture
In an Active/Passive Dual-Region Architecture on Microsoft Azure, key services like Application Service Environment (ASE), Azure App Services, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure Application Gateway ensure resilience. Regular health-checks are crucial for maintaining continuous availability and optimal performance.

ASE and App Services provide a secure and scalable platform, while Traffic Manager and Application Gateway handle global traffic distribution and load balancing. Conducting health-checks helps identify and address issues proactively, minimizing downtime and ensuring a resilient infrastructure. This is essential for business continuity, emphasizing the importance of a robust and reliable cloud setup.
