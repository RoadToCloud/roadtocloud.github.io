In app development and cloud computing, a Proof of Concept (POC) is a quick demo that checks if a new idea or project is doable and makes sense. It helps decide whether to move forward by showcasing key features and solving specific challenges before diving into full development in the cloud.  As shown in the picture below, a POC consists of four (4) separate steps:

1. Concept Development
2. Proof of Value
3. Proof of Technology
4. Concept Completion

# Benefits
The approach to proof of concepts (POCs) is straightforward, business-focused, and efficient. A team should prioritize consistency and objectivity, ensuring a rapid delivery of POCs. By identifying existing capabilities within the enterprise, a team can accelerate implementation and cuts costs. The method reduces potential impacts and incompatibilities with enterprise capabilities. A catalog of all POC efforts is maintained, preventing duplications and ensuring streamlined technology testing. Additionally, there is an emphasis on early utilization or updates to reference architectures, ensuring that POCs address new challenges rather than rehashing old ones.
