# The Big Picture
DevOps branching strategies are approaches used in software development to manage and organize code repositories effectively. These strategies dictate how development branches are structured, merged, and deployed, providing a framework for collaboration, version control, and seamless integration in the DevOps lifecycle.  However, it is important to remember that there is no one size fits all approach. Here I discuss four (4) well-known branching strategies, which represent a good summary of standard branching strategies but mutations and customizations of them are possible and frequent. These are *Trunk-based Development, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, and GitFlow*.

# Trunk-based Development (Centralized Workflow)
Trunk-based development emphasizes a single main branch with frequent small integrations to streamline collaboration. It prioritizes simplicity and continuous integration but may limit experimentation due to its singular focus. It is well-suited for smaller teams due to its simplicity and streamlined integration. However, larger teams may face challenges coordinating frequent integrations. Similarly, teams working across different geographic locations might find it easier to coordinate with a singular main branch, reducing the chances of conflicts.  This approach is best suited for a senior-level team.

**Key Points**
- Simple structure with a main branch, which is always ready for production
- Commits directly to main branch
- Other short-lived branches (less than 24 hours) acceptable
- Robust CI/CD is a *must*
- Feature flags are a *must*
- Ideal for teams of eight (8) or fewer developers

**Implementation Checklist**
- Educate engineers on workflow
- Confirm CI/CD is in great shape
- Confirm and validate feature flags
- Merge and delete any outstanding branches into *main* branch

**Pros**
- Very simple workflow
- Production matches latest commit
- Codebase always ready for production
- Improved developer experience
- Limited or few merge conflicts

**Cons**
- Strict CI/CD is a *must*
- Feature flags are a *must*
- Only really works with small teams
- Limited traceability
- Favors pair-programming over individual work

# GitHub Flow (Feature Branching)
Similar to Trunk-based Development, GitHub Flow also revolves around a main branch, with developers creating feature branches, submitting pull requests, and merging changes after code review. 

**Key Points**
- Long-living main branch, which is always ready for production
- Short-living feature branches
- Supports simultaneous feature development
- Strong CI/CD is a *must*
- Ideal for small to medium teams, between eight (8) and twelve (12) developers

**Implementation Checklist**
- Educate engineers on workflow
- Finish outstanding work and delete other branches
- Add branch restrictions (for Pull Requests) to main branch

**Pros**

**Cons**

# GitLab Flow

# Summary
In conclusion, trunk-based development, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, and GitFlow provide different approaches to branching, catering to varying project needs, team sizes and seniority. Trunk-based and GitHub/GitLab Flow are simpler and favor continuous integration, while GitFlow introduces more structure for traceability for projects with complex release strategies. The choice depends on the project's size, complexity, and the desired balance between simplicity and structure.
