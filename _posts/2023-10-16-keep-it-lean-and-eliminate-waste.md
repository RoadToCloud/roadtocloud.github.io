In the world of cloud computing, acknowledging and embracing change becomes not just a philosophy but a practical approach for staying competitive and efficiently utilizing the ever-evolving capabilities of the cloud.

"Keep it lean and eliminate waste" is a guiding principle across Lean, Agile, DevOps, and software development. In Lean, the focus is on minimizing unnecessary processes and maximizing value, ensuring efficiency. Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development, adapting to changes, and delivering functional software incrementally, aligning with the idea of keeping it lean. DevOps extends this concept to the entire software development lifecycle, promoting collaboration and automation to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance efficiency. In software development, the mantra encourages teams to cut out unnecessary features, streamline workflows, and stay agile to create products that meet user needs effectively. It's a unifying philosophy that promotes efficiency and continual improvement in the dynamic landscape of software development.

Lean, Agile and DevOps represent systems to force you to stop pretending that you know more than you really do. We must accept predictable unpredictability, embrace uncertainty, "epistemic humility".

Use data to create knowledge. Use Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for augmentation and efficiency, resilience and ultimately customer experience.


# The Seven Pillars

With the aim of keeping at lean and eliminating waste, I present the Seven Pillars.  These pillars provide a systematic and collaborative approach to work toward becoming lean and eliminating waste.
