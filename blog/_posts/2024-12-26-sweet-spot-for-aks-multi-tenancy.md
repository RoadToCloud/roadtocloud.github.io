# The Sweet Spot for Azure Kubernetes Service Multi-Tenancy

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications at scale. However, as organizations adopt AKS, the question of multi-tenancy often arises: how do you design an architecture that balances efficiency, cost, and security when serving multiple tenants? For smaller companies with limited funding, this question is particularly crucial. 

Having worked at a larger organization like Humana, where funding was not always the critical decider, I witnessed firsthand how cloud costs, initially seen as manageable, ballooned over time and became a significant issue. Now, working for a small company such as SafeTower, I’ve come to appreciate the "magic triangle" of funding (cloud cost), reliability, and security. These three elements must work hand in hand to build a sustainable and scalable infrastructure.

The answer lies in identifying the "sweet spot" for multi-tenancy. While the Azure Architecture Framework outlines several approaches—ranging from fully isolated clusters per tenant to namespace-based separation—there is a middle ground that offers an effective compromise for startups and smaller organizations. This post explores that sweet spot: using namespaces as tenant separators, combined with strict security measures to maintain isolation and control.

## Why Namespace-Based Multi-Tenancy?
Namespaces in Kubernetes provide logical separation within a cluster, making them an ideal candidate for multi-tenancy in cost-conscious environments. Here are a few reasons why namespace-based separation is appealing:

1. **Cost Efficiency:** Running separate clusters for each tenant can be prohibitively expensive. By sharing a single AKS cluster, you reduce the operational and financial overhead associated with maintaining multiple clusters.

2. **Resource Management:** Kubernetes namespaces allow you to apply resource quotas, limits, and policies at the namespace level. This enables you to allocate resources fairly and prevent tenants from over-consuming cluster resources.

3. **Scalability:** A namespace-based approach is well-suited to scaling tenant workloads within a single cluster, allowing smaller companies to start lean and expand gradually.

## Achieving Secure Namespace Separation
Security is a common concern when sharing a cluster across multiple tenants. To address this, it is critical to implement robust measures that prevent cross-tenant interference. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Network Policies:** Kubernetes’ built-in network policies or tools like Calico can enforce strict traffic isolation. For example, you can configure network policies to:
   - Block communication between namespaces.
   - Allow traffic only from trusted ingress controllers.
   - Restrict egress traffic to specific external endpoints.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Use Kubernetes RBAC to define granular access control. Ensure that each tenant only has access to their namespace and no visibility into other namespaces.

3. **Separate Resource Groups:** While namespaces handle separation within the cluster, other Azure resources (such as storage accounts, key vaults, or Azure Monitor) should reside in tenant-specific resource groups. This helps maintain compliance and simplifies billing and auditing.

4. **Pod Security Policies or OPA/Gatekeeper:** Enforce policies that restrict container capabilities, prevent privileged escalations, and ensure tenants deploy secure workloads.

## When to Outgrow Namespace-Based Multi-Tenancy
While namespace-based multi-tenancy is an excellent starting point, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. As your organization grows, you may reach a point where:

- **Tenant Workloads Become Resource-Intensive:** If one tenant’s resource consumption impacts others, you may need to isolate them into their own cluster.
- **Compliance Requirements Change:** Regulatory mandates might require complete isolation between tenants at the infrastructure level.
- **Operational Complexity Increases:** Managing a high number of namespaces and associated policies might outweigh the cost savings of a single cluster.

## Final Thoughts
For startups and smaller companies, namespace-based multi-tenancy offers a pragmatic balance between cost and control. By leveraging namespaces for separation and implementing strict security measures, you can create a multi-tenant architecture that scales with your business. Over time, as your organization grows and evolves, you can revisit your multi-tenancy strategy to ensure it continues to meet your needs.
